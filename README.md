# MyTrain
This is a small project to learn django. It is inspired by a friend who asked me to create a workout plan. When thinking about how to distribute the workout plan, an excel spreadsheet seemed like a boring and not very user-friendly option - so I thought why not create a small webapp to display workout schedules? I always had on my agenda to learn django, so this would be a good opportunity. The only downside is probably, that my friend will have to wait a little bit longer for the workout plan.

As of April 2024, I have started developiong ideas for the app and I am learning django by programming this app - however, it is still in the very early stage of development.
